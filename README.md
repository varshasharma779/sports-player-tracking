# sports-player-tracking
This project performs multi-player tracking in soccer videos using YOLOv11 for detection and DeepSORT for consistent ID assignment. It includes Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove overlapping detections and exports tracking results as annotated videos and CSV files. Ideal for sports analytics and re-identification tasks.
