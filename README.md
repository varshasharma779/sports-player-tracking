#  Player Tracking using YOLOv11 + DeepSORT

This project performs multi-player tracking in soccer videos using **YOLOv11** for detection and **DeepSORT** for consistent ID assignment. It includes Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove overlapping detections and exports tracking results as annotated videos and CSV files. Ideal for sports analytics and re-identification tasks.
